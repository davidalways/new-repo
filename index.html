    <p id='info'>JavaScript is the programming language of the web. You can use it to add dynamic behavior and store
      information.slice does not alter the original array. It returns a shallow copy of elements from the original
      array.
      Elements of the original array are copied into the returned array as follows:

      For objects, slice copies object references into the new array. Both the original and new array refer to the same
      object. If an object changes, the changes are visible to both the new and original arrays.
      For strings, numbers and booleans (not String, Number and Boolean objects), slice copies the values into the new
      array. Changes to the string, number, or boolean in one array do not affect the other array.
      If a new element is added to either array, the other array is not affected.

    <p id='more-info'>JavaScript can also handle requests and responses on a website. It's a great language to master
      for
      front-end and back-end web development.The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a
      new
      array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in
      that
      array. The original array will not be modified.

    <p class="centered" id="logo">Codecademy, Paragraphing is the practice of dividing a text into paragraphs. The
      purpose
      of paragraphing is to signal shifts in thinking and give readers a rest. Paragraphing is "a way of making visible
      to
      the reader the stages in the writer's thinking" (J. Ostrom, 1978)."Long paragraphs are daunting—rather like
      mountains—and they are easy to get lost in, for both readers and writers. When writers try to do too much in a
      single paragraph, they often lose the focus and lose contact with the larger purpose or point that got them into
      the
      paragraph in the first place. Remember that old high school rule about one idea to a paragraph? Well, it's not a
      bad
      rule, though it isn't exactly right because sometimes you need more space than a single paragraph can provide to
      lay
      out a complicated phase of your overall argument. In that case, just break wherever it seems reasonable to do so
      in
      order to keep your paragraphs from becoming ungainly.
      "When you draft, start a new paragraph whenever you feel yourself getting stuck—it's the promise of a fresh start.
      When you revise, use paragraphs as a way of cleaning up your thinking, dividing it into its most logical parts."
      (David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen, "Writing Analytically," 5th ed. Thomson Wadsworth, 2009)

    <p class="m">we will get there,"Paragraphing is not such a difficult skill, but it is an important one. Dividing up
      your writing into paragraphs shows that you are organized, and makes an essay easier to read. When we read an
      essay
      we want to see how the argument is progressing from one point to the next.
      "Unlike this book, and unlike reports, essays don't use headings. This makes them look less reader-friendly, so it
      is important to use paragraphs regularly, to break up the mass of words and to signal the making of a new point. .
      .
      . An unparagraphed page gives the reader the feeling of hacking away through a thick jungle without a track in
      sight—not very enjoyable and very hard work. A neat series of paragraphs acts like stepping stones that can be
      followed pleasurably across the river."
